    ```
2.  **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd python-essentials-practice
    ```
3.  **Explore the files**: Each `.py` file focuses on a specific topic. Open any file in your favorite code editor to review the code and comments.
4.  **Run the scripts**: Execute any script from your terminal to see the output and understand how it works.
    ```bash
    python file_name.py
    ```
5.  **Modify and Experiment**: The best way to learn is by doing\! Feel free to modify the code, add new features, or try to solve the problems in a different way. üßë‚Äçüíª
